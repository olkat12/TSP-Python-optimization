Group Project: Optimizing the Traveling Salesman Problem in Python

This repository showcases our group's approach to tackling the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using Python. The objective was to identify the most efficient routes across three different datasets. We implemented and compared several optimization algorithms, including:

- Nearest Neighbor
- Hill Climbing
- Tabu Search
- Simulated Annealing
- Genetic Algorithm
- Ant Colony Optimization
